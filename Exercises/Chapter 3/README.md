### Chapter 3 ###
1. Write an expression that checks whether an integer is odd or even.
2. Write a Boolean expression that checks whether a given integer is 
divisible by both 5 and 7, without a remainder.
3. Write an expression that looks for a given integer if its third digit (right 
to left) is 7.
4. Write an expression that checks whether the third bit in a given integer 
is 1 or 0.
5. Write an expression that calculates the area of a trapezoid by given 
sides a, b and height h.
6. Write a program that prints on the console the perimeter and the area 
of a rectangle by given side and height entered by the user.
7. The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the 
Earth. Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the 
moon by a given weight on the Earth.
8. Write an expression that checks for a given point {x, y} if it is within 
the circle K({0, 0}, R=5). Explanation: the point {0, 0} is the center of 
the circle and 5 is the radius.
9. Write an expression that checks for given point {x, y} if it is within the 
circle K({0, 0}, R=5) and out of the rectangle [{-1, 1}, {5, 5}]. 
Clarification: for the rectangle the lower left and the upper right corners 
are given.
10. Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd
(e.g. 2011) and performs the following actions:
- Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2+0+1+1 = 4).
- Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our 
example 1102).
- Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201).
- Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 
2101).
11. We are given a number n and a position p. Write a sequence of 
operations that prints the value of the bit on the position p in the 
number (0 or 1). Example: n=35, p=5 -> 1. Another example: n=35, 
p=6 -> 0.
12. Write a Boolean expression that checks if the bit on position p in the 
integer v has the value 1. Example v=5, p=1 -> false.
13. We are given the number n, the value v (v = 0 or 1) and the position p. 
write a sequence of operations that changes the value of n, so the bit on 
the position p has the value of v. Example: n=35, p=5, v=0 -> n=3. 
Another example: n=35, p=2, v=1 -> n=39.
14. Write a program that checks if a given number n (1 < n < 100) is a 
prime number (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
15. * Write a program that exchanges the values of the bits on positions 
3, 4 and 5 with bits on positions 24, 25 and 26 of a given 32-bit unsigned 
integer.
16. * Write a program that exchanges bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1} with bits {q, 
q+1, …, q+k-1} of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
