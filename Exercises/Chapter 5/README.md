### Chapter 5 ###
1. Write an if-statement that takes two integer variables and exchanges
their values if the first one is greater than the second one.
2. Write a program that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real 
numbers, without calculating it. Use a sequence of if operators.
3. Write a program that finds the biggest of three integers, using nested 
if statements.
4. Sort 3 real numbers in descending order. Use nested if statements.
5. Write a program that asks for a digit (0-9), and depending on the input, 
shows the digit as a word (in English). Use a switch statement.
6. Write a program that gets the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic 
equation: ax^2 + bx + c, calculates and prints its real roots (if they exist). 
Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.
7. Write a program that finds the greatest of given 5 numbers.
8. Write a program that, depending on the user’s choice, inputs int, double
or string variable. If the variable is int or double, the program 
increases it by 1. If the variable is a string, the program appends "*" at 
the end. Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.
9. We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that finds those 
subsets whose sum is 0. Examples:  
- If we are given the numbers {3, -2, 1, 1, 8}, the sum of -2, 1 and 1 
is 0.
- If we are given the numbers {3, 1, -7, 35, 22}, there are no subsets 
with sum 0.
10. Write a program that applies bonus points to given scores in the range 
[1…9] by the following rules:  
- If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
- If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
- If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
- If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints an error 
message.
11. Write a program that converts a number in the range [0…999] to 
words, corresponding to the English pronunciation. Examples:  
- 0 --> "Zero"
- 12 --> "Twelve"
- 98 --> "Ninety eight"
- 273 --> "Two hundred seventy three"
- 400 --> "Four hundred"
- 501 --> "Five hundred and one"
- 711 --> "Seven hundred and eleven"
