double and decimal: 5, -5.01, 34.567839023; 12.345; 8923.1234857;
3456.091124875956542151256683467?
3. Write a program, which compares correctly two real numbers with 
accuracy at least 0.000001.
4. Initialize a variable of type int with a value of 256 in
hexadecimal format (256 is 100 in a numeral system with base 16).
5. Declare a variable of type char and assign it as a value the character, 
which has Unicode code, 72 (use the Windows calculator in order to find 
hexadecimal representation of 72).
6. Declare a variable isMale of type bool and assign a value to it depending 
on your gender.
7. Declare two variables of type string with values "Hello" and "World". 
Declare a variable of type object. Assign the value obtained of 
concatenation of the two string variables (add space if necessary) to this 
variable. Print the variable of type object.
8. Declare two variables of type string and give them values "Hello" and 
"World". Assign the value obtained by the concatenation of the two 
variables of type string (do not miss the space in the middle) to a 
variable of type object. Declare a third variable of type string and 
initialize it with the value of the variable of type object (you should use 
type casting).
9. Declare two variables of type string and assign them a value “The 
"use" of quotations causes difficulties.” (without the outer quotes). 
In one of the variables use quoted string and in the other do not use it.
10. Write a program to print a figure in the shape of a heart by the sign "o".

employees. Each record should have the following characteristic – first 
name, last name, age, gender (‘m’ or ‘f’) and unique employee number 
(27560000 to 27569999). Declare appropriate variables needed to 
maintain the information for an employee by using the appropriate data 
types and attribute names.
13. Declare two variables of type int. Assign to them values 5 and 10 
respectively. Exchange (swap) their values and print them.
